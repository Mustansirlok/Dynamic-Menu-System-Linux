This guide will help you create a dynamic menu system in Bash. The menu will allow users to perform various administrative tasks such as user management, service control, and log inspection through an interactive text-based interface.

Step 1: Open the Terminal
On Mac or Linux OS:

Go to Applications, then Utilities, and open Terminal.
Alternatively, press Command + Space, type "Terminal", and press Enter.
On Linux:

Open your terminal emulator. It could be called Terminal, Konsole, GNOME Terminal, etc.

Step 2: Create a New Bash Script
In the terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to create your script file using the cd command.

For example, if you want to create the script in your Documents folder, you would navigate to that folder.
Create a new file for your script.
You can use a text editor like nano, vim, or gedit to create and edit your script file.
For example, to create a file named menu.sh with nano, you would open nano and create the file.

Step 3: Add the Shebang
The shebang line at the top of the script tells the system that the script should be run using Bash.
Add the following line at the very top of your script file: #!/bin/bash.

Step 4: Create the Menu Function
Define a function in your script that will display the menu options and read the user's choice.

This function will be the core of your menu system.
In the menu function, use a while loop to keep the menu running until the user chooses to exit.

Step 5: Add Menu Options
Inside the menu function, use echo statements to display the different menu options.

For example, you might have options for user management, service control, and log inspection.
Use a case statement to handle the user's input and call the appropriate functions for each menu option.

Step 6: Create Functions for Each Task
For each menu option, create a corresponding function in your script.
These functions will perform the specific administrative tasks.

Example Tasks:
User Management
Create a function that adds a new user, deletes a user, or lists all users.
Use commands like useradd, userdel, and cat /etc/passwd.

Service Control
Create a function that starts, stops, or restarts a service.
Use commands like systemctl start, systemctl stop, and systemctl restart.

Log Inspection
Create a function that displays system logs.
Use commands like cat /var/log/syslog, tail -n 100 /var/log/syslog, and grep to search logs.

Step 7: Display and Handle User Input
In the menu function, use the read command to get the user's input.

Prompt the user to enter a choice and store it in a variable.
Use the case statement to handle the user's choice and call the corresponding function.

Step 8: Make the Script Executable
Save your script file and exit the text editor.
Make the script executable by changing its permissions.
Use the chmod command to give the script execution permissions.

Step 9: Run the Script
In the terminal, navigate to the directory where your script is located.

Run the script by typing ./menu.sh.
